PREVENTING BANK CUSTOMER CHURN!

Data Set (freely downloadable) from :- https://www.kaggle.com/taneresme/churn-prediction/data
              This is the dataset used in the section "ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)" of the Udemy course from Kirill Eremenko (Data               Scientist & Forex Systems Expert) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Data Scientist), called Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial               Neural Networks. The dataset is very useful for beginners of Machine Learning, and a simple playground where to compare                 several techniques/skills.
          
BACK STORY :- A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10.000 records dataset to                                 investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.

              The story of the story: To compare several techniques to improve my basic knowledge on Machine Learning.
              
Aim to for this study:
              1. Identifying & visualizing the factors which contribute to customer churn.
              2. Build a prediction model.

I Feel to have left out some crucial observations I made while performing the churn prediction on the given data set, precisely after the Visualization part.
So felt like sharing with you people here.


I had some logical Issues hence I avoided including those observations, issues like :-
1. Data was confusing as to a few exited customers still had a bank balance? what did it mean?
2. What does the significance of an ActiveMember stand when his/her balance is Zero (0)?

Now, The POINTS TO BE NOTED!

For, Categorical Variables :-
1. Majority of data was of persons from France.
2. Proportion of Churned customers, Female > Male
3. Majority of Churned customers are those with credit card.
4. Inactive members have unsurprisingly, greater churn.

For, Continuous Variables :-
1. Rate of Older customers churning was greater than that of the young customers.
2. Customers with Extreme Tenures (extremely less/more time spent with the bank) churned > those with average time spent.
3. The bank was loosing customers with significant bank balance. (worrying)

Conclusions that I have made are avilable in the notebook of this project.
