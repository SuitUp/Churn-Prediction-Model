# Churn-Prediction-Model
Build a churn prediction model, using jupyter notebook.

PREVENTING BANK CUSTOMER CHURN!

Data Set (freely downloadable) from :- https://www.kaggle.com/taneresme/churn-prediction/data
              This is the dataset used in the section "ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)" of the Udemy course from Kirill Eremenko (Data                 Scientist & Forex Systems Expert) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Data Scientist), called Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial                 Neural Networks. The dataset is very useful for beginners of Machine Learning, and a simple playground where to compare                   several techniques/skills.
          
BACK STORY :- The story: A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10.000 records dataset to                     investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.

              The story of the story: To compare several techniques to improve my basic knowledge on Machine Learning.
              
Aim to for this study:
              1. Identifying & visualizing the factors which contribute to customer churn.
              2. Build a prediction model.
